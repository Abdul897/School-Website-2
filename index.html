             <p> At 8:45am they open the gates for children to come in the the school grounds. While they wait for the school gates to open they have to wait in the office area. When the gates open they line up and wait until 9:00am (the time there classes start). One by one they go upstairs to there classroom. First of, they put their stuff down and then they go straight to wash their hands. After that, they read their book until all their classmates arrive. When they all arrive, the teacher does the register then their first lessom starts (reading).</p> </section>
